 PURPOSE:
       Check that gnome-boxes runs and works correctly
 STEPS:
      1. Launch gnome-boxes from the desktop icon
      2. Make sure switching themes does what is expected. For example, if you are on light theme, then with the snap open, switch to dark theme and observe the snap adjusting to the dark theme.
      3. Make sure hamburger menu -> Help brings up the gnome-boxes Help page
      4. Execute the Install tests. (Instructions below)
      5. Execute launch/shutdown test by starting an existing VM and making sure it shuts down without error.
      6. Let the VM go to sleep and make sure it wakes up and takes you to the login screen. 
      7. Maximize the VM window and make sure it resizes to fit the screen.
      8. With an existing VM running, make sure you can mount/unmount an ISO and that the system sees it with `df`.
      9. Adjust the RAM/CPU resources on an existing VM and restart it. Make sure that is reflected in the running system, verified with `htop`.
      10. Play a video in Firefox and make sure the video/audio playback works as expected: https://videoplayback.vhx.tv/player-team-test/videos/bbb-sunflower-native-60fps-normal

 INSTALL TESTS
      FROM ISO
       - Create a new VM by clicking the "+" button in the top left corner.
       - Click "Install from File" and select a locally hosted .iso file. (If you do not have one, you can download one from cdimage.ubuntu.com.)
       - In the "New Virtual Machine" window, edit the name (to make sure that works) and click Create.
       - Select "Try or install Ubuntu" and go through the install.
       - Make sure you are prompted to unmount the ISO and restart after the install is complete. When the system restarts, make sure you are brought to a login screen, rather than being prompted to install again.

       - Click "Downoad OS" and try to download Ubuntu (or another OS)
